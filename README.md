Design and implement a STM32 Discovery board program exhibiting multitasking characteristics in simultaneously controlling a pair of servo motors using a custom interpreted control language. The system will be responsive to simultaneous independent, externally provided commands.
The servo positions are controlled with pulse-width modulation (PWM). This first portion of the project utilizes the STM32 Discovery board. Each servo will be controlled by its own recipe of commands in the custom interpreted control language.
